# Changelog

## v0.4.1 -> v1.0.0
`@ultimatemedical/uma-utils` is now a github package! I figured it's best to keep our packages in the same place, and since `@ultimatemedical/acorn` needed to be switched to GitHub Packages for Gatsby Cloud, I figured this was a necessary step. Switching to GitHub Packages required a name change, so that's why this is a major update.
